# PostNote
an website created with django where users shares note with one other. 

The project was mostly created on top of another simple messaging app where one user post something and every other user had the ability to see on their index page. 
All the requierement with the project was met until a major issue sharing notes occured. 
Now users could post notes but cannot share with other users. 
Notes are visibilly avaliable on the Django Administration web page but program does not share the notes. 
So what I am being focusing to improve  was the code provides the functionality to share note with other users.
Help really appriciated. Thank you so much!!
